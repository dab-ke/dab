        description: "Introducing LeatherWalk, a footwear brand dedicated to timeless craftsmanship and personalized leather shoes. With the slogan 'Walk Forever' LeatherWalk blends quality and legacy to offer both casual and official footwear that speaks to individual style and durability. <br>I took on the challenge of building the digital face of LeatherWalk — a custom footwear platform designed to evolve into a full-fledged e-commerce experience. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I crafted the frontend with careful attention to detail, ensuring each interaction feels as premium as the products themselves. I designed the layout in Figma, paying close attention to intuitive navigation, color harmony, and visual storytelling that aligns with the brand’s identity. While the project is still in development, the goal is to create a seamless shopping experience for shoe enthusiasts — from exploring handcrafted designs to placing custom orders. LeatherWalk is not just about shoes, it’s about building a digital space that reflects the soul of the brand: legacy, comfort, and style.",
